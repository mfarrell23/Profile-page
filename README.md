# Profile-page
This project is callled Michelle's Profile Page.
This page is a small profile for future employees to take a peek at me.
My page is meant to provide some incite as to who I am, and what i can do.
It provides links to my future work that I will create and deploy.
You can use the navigation bar to direct where in this page you would lke to be for easy reading.
This page has been modified with CSS so that is can flex to the size of screen you are using to view it.

URL used for assistance: https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

I recieved some very helpful insight from the tutors on editing my page to make it run smoothly.
